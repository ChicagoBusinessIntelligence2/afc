                  <h5><a name="Buying a Home With a View">Buying a House</a></h5>
                  
                  <p>Homes with a pleasant
        view of the horizon often sell at a premium above similar homes without
        the view. However, if a view is important to you, buy it mostly for your
        own pleasure and not as an investment. Though you may place a
        considerable dollar value on the view, future buyers may not be so
        like-minded. It may take you longer to find a buyer when it comes time
        to resell the house. Or you may end up dropping your price to more
        nearly match other sales prices in the neighborhood.</p>

                  <p>In short, if you are
        buying a house with a view, try to pay as little extra as possible.
        Otherwise, you might not get your money back.</p>
        
                  <h5><a name="Lot and Landscaping">Lot and Landscaping</a></h5>
                  
                  <p>Even though most real
        estate value is usually concentrated in the building, the lot is
        important, too. Obviously, it should be as level as possible. Assuming
        the property is in a typical neighborhood, the lot should be rectangular
        – no odd shaped lots or oddly situated lots.</p>
                  <p>Yard sizes are smaller in
        modern homes than in older homes, but there should still be a decently
        sized front and back yard. Do not buy a house where the entire back yard
        is taken up by a swimming pool, for example.</p>
                  <p>Do not purchase an
        over-landscaped property, either. You would normally pay a premium for
        that, which you may not be able to recover when you sell. You will get
        your best value if the house is moderately landscaped or
        under-landscaped for the area. You can always improve the landscaping
        during your ownership by improving the grass and adding bushes and
        trees. Just do not spend too much.</p>
                  <h5><a name="House Size">House Size</a></h5>
                  <p>In each residential
        neighborhood, houses will vary in size and rooms, but they should not be too
        different. If resale value is an important consideration, you should not
        buy the largest model in the neighborhood. When determining market
        value, the homes nearest to yours are most important. If most of the
        nearby houses are smaller than your house, they can act as a drag on
        appreciation.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, if you
        buy a small or medium house for the neighborhood, the larger homes can
        help pull up your value. This is one of those times where determining
        your &quot;wants&quot; versus your &quot;needs&quot; can be extremely
        important. Buying what you <b><i>need</i></b> in a more prestigious
        neighborhood may provide more financial reward than getting what you <b><i>want</i></b>
        in a less desirable neighborhood.</p>
                  <h5><a name="Bedrooms and Bathrooms">Bedrooms and Bathrooms</a></h5>
                  <p>Three and four bedroom
        houses are the most popular among homebuyers, so if you can stick in
        that range you will have more potential buyers when it comes time to
        resell. Five is okay, too, as long as you do not have to pay too much
        extra for the additional bedroom.</p>
                  <p>There should always be at
        least two bathrooms in a house, preferably at least two and a half. One
        bathroom with a place to wash up for day-to-day visitors, one for the
        master bedroom, and at least one to be shared by the other bedrooms.</p>
                  <h5><a name="Closets and Garages">Closets, Garages, and Laundry</a></h5>
                  <p>Walk-in closets are
        extremely desirable for the master bedroom. For the rest of the house,
        just be sure there is plenty of closet space. Don’t forget space for
        linens and towels.</p>
                  <p>Garages add to the resale
        value and you should always make sure to get at least a two-car garage.
        Lately, three-car garages have become desirable in some areas of the
        country.</p>
                  <p>The laundry facilities
        should be located somewhere convenient on the main floor of the house,
        but not in a place it will create an eyesore. Think about whether you
        want to walk up and down stairs when carrying loads of laundry.</p>
                  <h5><a name="The Kitchen">The Kitchen</a></h5>
                  <p>Family activity centers
        around the kitchen, so this is the most important room of the house.
        Larger kitchens are better, and they should be provided with modern
        appliances. Obviously, the dining room and breakfast nook should be
        located adjacent to the kitchen. In newer houses, the family room should
                      also be extremely close to the kitchen.</p>
                  <p>There should
                      be easy access to the
        back yard, as there will be occasions for barbecues and outdoor
        entertaining. In addition, it should be a short trek between the garage
        to the kitchen so hauling groceries in from the car does not become a
        horrendous chore.</p>
                  <h5><a name="Fireplaces">Fireplaces</a></h5>
                  <p>The only room where you
        absolutely have to have a fireplace is the family room. A fireplace in
        the living room may be nice, but you pay extra for it and will probably
        rarely use it. At best, it serves as a focal point of the living room,
        but does not add much in real value.</p>
                  <h5><a name="Swimming Pools">Swimming Pools</a></h5>
                  <p>Swimming pools do not
        provide as much added value as they once did. Safety issues about families
        with younger children have become more publicized than in the past, so
        families with small children tend to avoid homes with pools. As a
        result, having a pool may actually reduce the number of potential
        homebuyers when you try to resell the home.</p>
                  <p>Buy a home with a pool
        for your own enjoyment, not as an investment.</p>
                  <p>Since we are on the subject of swimming
        pools, here is a word of advice: If you want a pool, buy a home that
        already has a pool. Paying a contractor to install one for you is like
        throwing money away. You will never get a dollar-for-dollar return on
        your investment.</p>
